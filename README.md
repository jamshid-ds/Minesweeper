Let's create numbers for safe squares in Minesweeper!
ðŸ’¡ If you've used previous versions of Windows, you're familiar with Minesweeper:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)
If you're not familiar with the game, imagine a stack of squares: some of these squares hide mines. If you hit a mine, you lose immediately. If you click on a safe square, you will immediately see a number showing how many mines are in the adjacent squares. The goal of the game is to uncover all the non-mine squares on the grid.

In this notebook, we will create a DataFrame containing the necessary information for the Minesweeper game: the coordinates of the squares, whether there are mines in the square, and the number of mines found in neighboring squares!
